            <h4 class="h4">About me</h4>
            <p><strong>Tell me about your path to becoming a designer.</strong></p>
            <p>Ive always liked to randomly during classes. I started taking art classes in highschool. I took every art class my school offered. After switching majors twice I finally switched to Graphic Design. My current path is to finish the design classes offered at TCC. After completing the courses their my next goal will be to transfer to a four year university. After transfering I will continue to take the design classes for my degree. </p>
            <p><strong>Tell me about your aspirations as a designer.</strong></p>
            <p>The best outcome for me would be to be able to have a career in designing. I hope to get to the point of design where my work is good enough and unique enough to be able to have that career. I like the idea of being able to make advertisements for products. Flier designs and coding for websites are the most appealing to me so far. I hope That I can continue to grow as a designer and get better at these design types and see where it leads.</p>
