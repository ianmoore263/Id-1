        <h1>Daft Punk Website Analysis</h1>
        <ol>
            <!--Question 1-->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The Font they use for the header is like a brush stroke. The Paragraphs and pull qoutes use more modern looking fonts.</p>
            <!--Question 2-->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>they use black and white for the text and have some blue sky in part of their background which turns to greenish yellow.</p>
            <!--Question 3-->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals really go with their music of the futuristic theme they go for. When scrolling on the page the visuals have a chance of being messed up. If you scroll to fast and it takes a little for it to catch up. I cant tell if this is internet lag or a problem with the website.</p>
            <!--Question 4-->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>The sections are separated by the pictures of them and the sky that has a gradiant of color on it. They used gifs of themselves as well.</p>
