        <h1>Exercise 7: Website Analysis</h1>
        <h2>96 Elephants</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I feel the website is dark looking with a dull grey color. The site has a sad color palet.</li>
            
            <li>On the chapter page they used three red boxes that give bright comparison to the gray and black colors. I never felt lost following the pages as it covered the whole page and just scrolled all the way down to the next chapter.</li>
            
            <li>It transition to a next chapter. It was the end of the article. Chapter 3 allowed you to click on links for the help of the elephants linking you to different pages and websites that allow you to help.</li>
            
            <li>I feel the creators of this site realize the importance of elephants and want to help with the preservation of them. They are trying to get people to see the need of elephants and trying to spread the word on helping them.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Elizabeth River Trail</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I would say that the design of this site is lively and outdoorsy</li>
            
            <li>the navigation works by using links on the homepage to take you to another part of their website. They have a explore page which lets you scroll down the trail and see the notible parts of the trail. They also had the get involved page which let you help with the future of the project.</li>
            
            <li>I feel the page names take you to appropriate pages for what the content shows.</li>
            
            <li>They seem to want to spread more information about the trail letting more people know about it. It also seems like they want to get donations or volunteers to help with the future of this program they are doing.</li>
        </ol>
