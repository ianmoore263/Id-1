        <h1><u>The state of the world</u></h1>
        <p><strong>What do you love about it?</strong></p>
        <p>Things that I love about this world outweight the things I hate. I love my family and my friends. I love being able to play games on computer, and being able to go outside and be active. Eating food is one of my passions and without the variety of food it would be boring.</p>

        <p><strong>What do you hate about it?</strong></p>
        <p>Things I hate about this world are few in number. one main hate is the way certain political affairs are going. I dislike when certain things don't go as planned and throw a wrench in your life. I also hate public speaking and I am not looking forward to doing that in this class.</p>

        <p><strong>What about it do you wish you could change?</strong></p>
        <p>I feel I am at no liberty to change the way things are going in this world. If I had to choose things I'd want to change it would be to be able to travel more. Worrying about school and work are preventing certain vacations and traveling with family.</p>
